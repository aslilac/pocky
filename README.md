# Pocky

There are already a ton of tools available out there for generating static sites, so why
create another one?

Well, that's the thing. Pocky isn't a static site generator! It's a set of pieces that you
can join together to create your own static site generator. Other tools have limited
configuration options, or make lots of assumptions about how you want to describe your
content. Additionally, I just enjoy coding, and so the idea of a framework that I can code
with is much more appealing to me than writing some JSON or YAML to be piped into a tool
that feels much more opaque. When you're already writing code, I think it removes the
context switching barrier that you might feel when you're writing configuration and hit
some limitation or bug that would require writing code to fix.
